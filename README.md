# Polybius-Cypher
2 Python files that Encrypt and decrypt in a Polybius square
Encryptor Gets Kind of weird when it sees special characters.
Least concise character guide ever:
! = -112
? = -52
@ = -53
# = -114
$ = -115
% = -111
^ = 13
& = -102
* = -101
( = -104
) = -105
- = -94
= = -65
_ = 14
+ = -92
' = -103
" = -113
; = -63
: = -62
, = -93
. = -95
< = -64
> = -61
/ = -91
` = 15
~ =64
Feel free to change it to a "Leggoome cipher" or something to include all of these.
